	501 263 764
	503 261 764
	561 203 764
	563 201 764

	We can see that despite the multiple solutions, the values of G,H,I are 4,6,7 in some order.
	Multiplying them out you get 168.
	From there you can multiply by the given value, 447.2, where you get 75129.6
	Taking int of that value you get 75129

	The first solution we get is 1024375869. We can see that there are thousands of solutions.
	Given that the program is incrementing from the smallest possible number, 1023456789,
	this means that the first value you get is the smallest.
	From there you can multipy by the given value, 0.000025, where you get 25,609.396725.
	Taking int of that value you get 25609
